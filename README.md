**Problem 1: Language Basics**

Readings: Language Basics: Variables, Operators, Expressions, Statements, and Blocks 
Look at the code below which calculates the radius of a circle in feet and inches, given that the 
circle has a given area. Download source (JAVA). 
public class MathCalc
{ 
public static void main(String[] args)
{ 
double radius = 0.0;
double circleArea = 100.0;
int feet = 0;
int inches = 0;
radius = Math.sqrt(circleArea/Math.PI);
feet = (int)Math.floor(radius);
inches = (int)Math.round(12.0*(radius - feet));
System.out.println("The radius of a circle with area" +
circleArea 
+ " square feet is\n " + feet + " feet " + inches + "
inches"); 
}
} 
The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles. The diameter of the Earth is 
approximately 7600 miles. Use the methods in the class Math to calculate, 
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles 
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles 
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth 
and then output the three values. Treat both the earth and sun as spheres. The volume of a 
sphere is given by the formula 4 pi r^3/3 where r is the radius. 
Run the code you have written, and turn in both your code and the output of the program. The 
output should say something like: The volume of the Earth is X cubic miles, the volume of the 
sun is Y cubic miles, and the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is Z

**Problem 2: Language Basics**

public class Primes
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int nValues = 50;
boolean isPrime = true;
for(int i = 2; i <= nValues; i++)
{
isPrime = true; 
ΤΜ
 for (int j = 2; j < i; j++)
{
if (i % j == 0)
{
isPrime = false;
break;
}
}
if (isPrime)
System.out.println(i);
}
}
} 
Create a new program that has the following features. Download source (JAVA). 
(a) Uses labeled continue instead of break. 
(b) Does not require the isPrime variable. 
(c) When testing whether an integer is prime, it is sufficient to try and divide by integers up to 
the square root of the number being tested. 
Turn in your rewritten code. 

**Problem 3: Object Basics**

Strings 
In the following code the soliloquy is analyzed character by character to determine the vowels, 
spaces and letters used. Fill in the code that computes the number of spaces, vowels, and 
consonants. Download source (JAVA). 
public class StringCharacters
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String text = "To be or not to be, that is the question;"
+"Whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer" 
+" the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,"
+" or to take arms against a sea of troubles,"
+" and by opposing end them?";
int spaces = 0,
vowels = 0,
letters = 0;
//YOUR CODE HERE
System.out.println("The text contained vowels: " + vowels + "\n"
+ 
consonants " + (letters - vowels) + "\n"+ spaces: " + spaces);
}
} 
Run the program once you have written your code. Turn in your code, and the output 
produced when the code runs.

Numbers 
Arrays 
Write a program that sets up a String variable with the soliloquy in the previous question, 
extracts the words from the text and sorts them into alphabetical order. You may define 
'words' however you wish (within reason), but provide your definition with your solution. You 
can use the sorting method of your choice. The simplest one is the bubble sort, which works 
as follows: 
• Starting with the first element in the array compare successive elements (0 and 1, 1 
and 2, 2 and 3, and so on). 
• If the first element of any pair is greater than the second, interchange the two 
elements. 
• Repeat the process for the whole array until no interchanges are necessary. The array 
elements will now be in ascending order. 
• Run the program once you have written your code. Turn in your code, and the output 
produced when the code runs.
